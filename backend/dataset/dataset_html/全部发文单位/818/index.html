First, the STAR basics will be introduced. In particular, the fundamental signal modelling, performance limit characterization, practical operating protocols, and joint beamforming design will be discussed. Then, the coupled phase-shift STAR model, AI enabled STARS, and channel estimation methods will be focused. Furthermore, several promising case studies of employing STARS will be put forward, including STAR-NOMA, spatial analysis for STARS, federated learning with STARS, and STARS enabled integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Finally, research opportunities and problem as well as commercial progress of STARS.</div><div><br/></div><div> </div><div><br/></div><div><b>报告人简介</b></div><div><br/></div><div><img src="/board/uploadimg/2022108560804.gif"/>Yuanwei Liu is an Associate Professor with the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London.
