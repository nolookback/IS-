<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0pt">The growing scale and complexity of large models in medical data analysis pose significant efficiency challenges, especially when applied in federated learning environments for privacy preservation. This talk presents our three ongoing works to address these challenges. First, we tackle the issue of communication costs in fine-tuning federated large models by modifying the TopK model update compression algorithm. Second, we explore resource-efficient strategies for federated full model tuning by pruning parameters, ensuring that only a subset of parameters is updated in each training round. Third, we exemplify the application of federated large models in the medical sector. In the end, we summarize and envision future works to offer a promising path for deploying federated large models in the resource-constrained medicine sector while maintaining model performance.</p>
