报告摘要：
From frequency selective surfaces to Huygens metasurfaces, novel electromagnetic surfaces have been emerging in both scientific exploration and engineering applications. Many intriguing phenomena occur on these surfaces, and novel devices and applications have been proposed accordingly, which have created an exciting paradigm in electromagnetics, the so-called “Surface Electromagnetics (SEM)”. As a representative example, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) exhibits promising potential in communications, radars, and imaging applications. This report will briefly introduce the development of surface electromagnetics, and presents some research frontiers on surface electromagnetics, including both theoretical advancement and engineering applications.
