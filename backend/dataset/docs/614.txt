摘要：
The race to develop next-generation wireless
electronics is accelerating at a rapid pace. Thanks to advanced additive
manufacturing technology, fast prototyping, low-entry-cost, and in-house
short-run manufacturing empower millions of start-ups and companies with
demanding confidentiality and accelerated innovation. We aim to build a new
class of high-performance functional metasurfaces to advance the knowledge for
future microwave devices. Compact and low-cost 3D-printed metasurfaces in
millimetre-wave and terahertz bands will be comprehensively investigated to
circumvent the limitations of traditional manufacturing technologies. The
proposed 3D metasurfaces should be easily integrated into high-speed microwave
and photonics systems in a dynamic environment. A/Prof. Yang’s group has
demonstrated a new concept of 3D metasurfaces designed using emerging additive
manufacturing technologies. The proposed designs are prototyped using silver
and acrylate inks. The combination of 3D metasurface designs and multi-material
additive manufacturing is new to the communities interested in emerging
materials and manufacturing techniques for the dynamic manipulation of
electromagnetic waves, from microwave to terahertz.
嘉宾个人简介：
Yang Yang
(IEEE Senior Member) was born in Bayan Nur, Inner Mongolia, China and
received the PhD degree in Electronic Engineering from Department of Electrical
and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, Australia, in
2013.
Dr Yang
was with the
State Key Laboratory of Terahertz and Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong
Kong, in 2016. Since December 2016, he joined the University of Technology
Sydney (UTS), Australia. He is currently an Associate Professor and a Group
Leader of 3D Millimetre-Wave
and
Terahertz
Circuits and Antennas in UTS Tech Lab. His research interests include emerging
RF materials and additive manufacturing techniques for 3D millimetre-wave and
terahertz device designs for 5G and biomedical applications. He has over 240
international publications in microwave, millimetre-wave and terahertz circuits
and antennas.
In 2022, Dr Yang received the Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and
Facilities (LIEF) Award funded by the Australian Research Council to establish
the national laboratory of Australian 3D Terahertz Beam Measurement Platform
(500 GHz). Dr Yang
