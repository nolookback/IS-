Multiscale characterisation of microstructure and micromechanical properties of a novel low-carbon and sustainable construction material
Speaker Dr. Guohao Fang
University College London (UCL)
About the Speaker
Dr. Fang received Ph.D. from University College London (UCL) in 2020. His research mainly focuses on the multiscale analysis of low-carbon sustainable and intelligent construction materials. Up to now, he has published 20 high-quality SCI journal papers, including 9 first author’s papers and 11 co-author’s papers.
Talk Introduction
The traditional Portland cement has been regarded as the non-sustainable construction material due to its huge carbon emissions with around 8% global man-made CO
2
emissions and large consumption of natural source (e.g., limestone), which motivates researchers for seeking suitable alternatives to this material. In recent years, alkali-activated material (AAM) is regarded as an environmental-friendly alternative by utilising industry by-products such as fly ash and slag, leading to up to 75% less CO
2
emissions. The performances of AAM are highly dependent on its heterogeneous microstructure with multiscale (nano- to macro-scale) and multiphase (pores, reaction products, unreacted particles and aggregates). Understanding the multiscale chemistry, structure and properties of AAM is of importance to optimise its performance and mitigate such environmental impacts. This seminar will cover my current research regarding the multiscale analysis of chemical reaction, microstructure and micromechanical properties of AAM and explore the interesting research topics in the future.
