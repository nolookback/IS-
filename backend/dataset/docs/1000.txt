Abstract:
In this talk,
we will consider the problem of sensing under Poisson distributed reflectors in
the field leading to non-Gaussian and non-Rayleigh statistics. In particular,
we will develop two new families of models generalizing the Rayleigh
distribution and the Rician distribution. We will present extensive simulation
results on SAR images. The models provide a theoretically sound framework which
is applicable also in other types of sensing images such as biomedical images
and in multipath fading.
Biography:
Ercan E. Kuruoğlu
received MPhil and PhD degrees in information engineering from the
University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom, in 1995 and 1998,
respectively. In 1998, he joined Xerox Research Center Europe, Cambridge. He
was an ERCIM fellow in 2000 with INRIA-Sophia Antipolis, France. In January
2002, he joined Institute of Science and Technology of Information-CNR (Italian
National Council of Research), Pisa, Italy where he became a Chief Scientist in
2020. He is currently a Visiting Professor at Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen
Institute. He served as an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Signal
Processing and IEEE Transactions on Image Processing. He is currently the
Editor in Chief of Digital Signal Processing: A Review Journal. He acted as a
Technical co-Chair for EUSIPCO 2006 and a Tutorials co-Chair of ICASSP 2014. He
is a member of the IEEE Technical Committee (TC) on Signal Processing Theory and
Methods, TC on Machine Learning for Signal Processing and TC on Image, Video
and Multidimensional Signal Processing. He was a plenary speaker at DAC 2007,
ISSPA 2010, IEEE SIU 2017, Entropy 2018, MIIS 2020, ISMSIP 2021 and tutorial
speaker at IEEE ICSPCC 2012. He was an Alexander von Humboldt Experienced
Research Fellow in the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in
2013-2015. His research interests are in the areas of statistical signal and image
processing, machine learning and information and coding theory with
applications in remote sensing, telecommunications and computational biology.
