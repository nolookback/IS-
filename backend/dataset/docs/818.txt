讲座摘要
Abstract: In this talk, the novel concept of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surfaces (STARS) will be introduced. First, the STAR basics will be introduced. In particular, the fundamental signal modelling, performance limit characterization, practical operating protocols, and joint beamforming design will be discussed. Then, the coupled phase-shift STAR model, AI enabled STARS, and channel estimation methods will be focused. Furthermore, several promising case studies of employing STARS will be put forward, including STAR-NOMA, spatial analysis for STARS, federated learning with STARS, and STARS enabled integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Finally, research opportunities and problem as well as commercial progress of STARS.
