Dr. Huiru Tang is a Distinguished Professor (metabonomics and systems biology) in Fudan University (School of Life Sciences and Zhangshan Hospital). For last decades, he has been developing metabonomics methods and studying metabolic aspects of important diseases and the symbiotic interactions between mammalian hosts and their gut microbiota.
After earned his PhD in chemistry from University of London in 1994, he worked at Institute of Food Research, UK, and Imperial College London as a Senior Scientist before joining the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2005 as a professor. He joined Fudan University in 2014. He authored over 210 peer-reviewed papers with over 13000 citations (h-index: 64). He has been a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry since 2005 and received an Award for Outstanding Young Scholars in 2008. He is editorial board members (or Associated Editors) for numerous scientific journals, Executive Committee Members of ENC and several scientific societies in China. He has been the President of the Metabonomics Society of China since 2018.

摘要
：
Human metabonome contains more than 20 thousand metabolites which have many different functions with a huge concentration dynamic range, diverse properties and matrices. Quantitative metabolomic analysis is essential for understanding the molecular aspects of mammalian biology, physiology, pathophysiology of various diseases and hence precision medicine. During last decades, metabolomics science has made huge progress in both technical and application areas. To achieve accurate quantitative metabolomic analysis, however, developing efficient novel analytical technologies remains to be one of the most urgent and extremely challenging tasks. NMR and MS are the dominant analytical tools though their combinations have increasingly become attractive with complementary information from them. This presentation will deal with the requirements of quantitative metabonomics and strategies to fulfill such tasks followed with some recent methodological advances. We will also discuss the major challenges metabolomic analysis is facing and possible strategies to overcome such problems with some integrated multiple-omics results presented. We will report some important applications here.
