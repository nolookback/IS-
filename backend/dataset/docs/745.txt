讲座内容简介：
As an emerging field, Science and Science (SciSci) attaches great attention recently. The goal of SciSci is to understand how science works and what can we do to make it better.  Philosophers have debated over that for centuries.
However
, only in digital era, large scale data sets make quantitative study possible. Researchers adopt methods from statistics, computer science, network science and social science to answer questions like: what is impact factor? Why we need that? Why Alice’s paper has 10000 citations and Bob’s paper only 3? In which stage scientists are likely to published their most important papers? And so on. In this talk, I’ll give a brief introduction to SciSci, it’s interesting origin, several important findings and open questions.
