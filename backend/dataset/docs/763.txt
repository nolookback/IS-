Abstract: In federated learning (FL), clients can collaboratively train a machine learning model by only exposing their model parameters. Blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) upgraded from FL can record all intemediate computation results, e.g., model updates, into a blockchain so that the computation process is tracable and all intermediate computation results cannot be tampered. This talk will review the communication challenges in BFL and discuss how to diminish communication overhead of BFL by model compression to discard model updates of a small magnitude from BFL. Simulations with real-world datasets demonstrate that the communication cost can be sheer reduced by compression algorithms.  In the end, we also envision the future of BFL by exploring the possibility to record more valuable information into the blockchain.
