ETH Zurich
About the Speaker
From 2015.09-2020.04, Dr. Jianhua Zhang studied biomedical engineering in ETH Zurich, where he also received his doctoral degree. Subsequently, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher in ETH Zurich. His research interests include 3D bioprinting, bone biology and mechanobiology. He is an author of 17 SCI scientific articles with over 860 citation.
Talk Introduction
Bone tissue engineering (BTE) is a promising approach to create functional bone tissues in vitro by the combination of scaffold, cells and environmental cues. One promising area in BTE is creating in vitro tissue models to better understand bone tissue development, disease mechanism and to test and screen drugs. 3D bioprinting process is based on additive manufacturing that shows the potential to build functional human bone tissues through the precise placement of living cells and biomaterials in a layer-by-layer fashion. This talk aims to generate 3D functional human bone tissues in vitro using 3D bioprinting technique. The strategy was bioprinting of 3D hMSCs-laden bone tissues to have cellular diversity by the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs and to form highly mineralized tissue by extracellular matrix mineralization. Three approaches had been investigated in this talk, including: (1) adjusting tissue stiffness and cell density, (2) designing advanced bioink, (3) applying external mechanical loading.
