报告摘要：
Autonomous driving, while promising, raises
concerns about safety and reliability. Unlike traditional software, autonomous
driving systems (ADSs) merge deep neural networks with logic-based modules,
presenting unique software testing challenges. Despite new ADS testing
techniques, the practical needs of ADS practitioners are yet to be fully
met.
Our series of
works aim to address this. We first conducted a comprehensive study to
understand current testing practices in ADS (FSE’22), followed by a project to
streamline testing for multi-module ADSs (FSE’22). Additionally, we developed a
method to generate test cases from traffic rules for testing autonomous driving
models (TSE’22). Future work will build on
analyzing
robustness issues in deep learning driving models (PerCom’20),moving towards
incorporating formal guarantee in ADS testing.
报告人简介：
Dr. Xi Zheng received the Ph.D. in Software
Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2015. From 2005 to 2012,
he was the Chief Solution Architect for Menulog Australia. He is currently the
Director of Intelligent Systems Research Group (ITSEG.ORG),Director of
International engagement in the School of Computing, Senior Lecturer
(equivalent to
Associate Professor US) and Deputy Program Leader in Software Engineering,
Macquarie University, Australia. His research interests include Cyber-Physical
Systems Testing and Verification, Safety Analysis, Distributed Learning,
Internet of Things, and Software Engineering in general. He has secured more
than $1.2 million competitive funding　n Australian Research
Council (Linkage and Discovery) and Data61 (CRP) projects on safety analysis,
model testing and verification, and trustworthy AI on autonomous vehicles. He
also won a few awards including Deakin Industry Researcher (2016) and MQ
Earlier Career Researcher (Runner-up 2020). He has a number of highly cited
papers and best conference papers. He served as PC members for Software and
System flagship conferences including FSE (2022,2024) and Per Com (2017-2024).
He also served as the PC chairs of IEEE CPSCom-2021, IEEE Broadnets-2022 and
associate editor for ACM Distributed Ledger Technologies.
