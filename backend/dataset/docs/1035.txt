Development of Emerging Photovoltaics: Kesterite and Perovskite Solar Cells
Speaker Dr. Haibing Xie
Sun Yat-sen University
About the Speaker
Dr. Xie received his Ph.D. degree from University of Barcelona, and then worked as a postdoc at Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2) and a visiting scientist in école polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). His current interests include perovskite solar cells and emerging optoelectronic materials for photovoltaic applications.
Talk Introduction
Solar energy is urgently demanded to address the issue of carbon neutrality. Commercially available solar cells either have a high thermal budget (e.g., Si solar cell), or are limited by high cost ingredients (e.g., indium in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell) and toxic compositions (e.g., Cd in CdTe solar cell). Kesterite (Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4) solar cells and organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) (ABX3, A= methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), Cs; B= Pb; X= I, Br) are emerging photovoltaic technologies developed last decade. Kesterite solar cell is based on absorbers with earth-abundant and non-toxic elements, being considered to be a substitute for Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell. Solution-based PSCs achieve over 25% efficiency while the long-term stability remains one of the challenges for this technology towards commercialization. In this talk, the development of kesterite and perovskite solar cells will be introduced, and solutions to address the challenges of these emerging solar cells will be discussed.
