报告摘要：
This presentation introduces a novel Wireless Power Transfer system designed explicitly for distance-tolerant and angle-insensitive. The system incorporates a Fabry-Perot Cavity (FPC) and a Rectifying Metasurface (ReMS), effectively addressing the challenge of maintaining stable Direct Current (DC) output power across varying distances. The FPC antenna serves as the transmitter, while the ReMS, as one layer of the multi-layer FPC, combines the functionalities of a receiver and rectifier. The ReMS captures Radio Frequency (RF) energy from various incident angles through its top surface's cross dipoles. Its bottom rectification network is designed based on the performance of the FPC antenna, aiming to improve the efficiency of RF-to-DC conversion. Comprising 64 cells, the ReMS achieves an energy harvesting efficiency of up to 95% at various incident angles. Additionally, the rectifier's design has been validated with a peak rectifying efficiency of 63%. Prototype results indicate that the system, at an average unit input power of 10 dBm, attains considerably stable DC output power over a range of distances, with a total efficiency of approximately 40%-50%. The outcomes of this work lay the groundwork for developing self-powered units with wireless transmission capabilities, ideal for intelligent devices subject to frequent locational changes.
