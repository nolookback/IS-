报告人简介：
The Chi laboratory is committed to the state-of-art original chemistry research that addresses problems of both fundamental and practical significance. A key objective is to develop green and efficient synthetic methods to make functional molecules, and to understand the principles guiding the bong breaking and formation events. For the past ten years, the Chi lab has developed new activation modes and synthetic transformations enabled by N-Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) as the key organic catalyst. In the years to come, the Chi lab is moving beyond methodology development and laboratory scale chemical synthesis. Examples of current projects include chemo-selective reactions for biomolecules and their analogous (such as saccharides), antibacterial and antiviral agricultural chemicals, medicinal molecules and prodrugs, ultra-efficient reactions, green process for industrial scale applications, and applied research for innovation and entrepreneurship
