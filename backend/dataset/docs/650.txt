摘要：
The utilization of General Artificial Intelligence
(GAI) as a personal intelligent tutor has the potential to revolutionize
teaching and learning. By leveraging GAI's vast knowledge and computational
power, learners can benefit from personalized guidance, adaptability, and continuous
feedback throughout their educational journeys. This seminar explores the
development of employing GAI in the role of an intelligent virtual tutor.
Personalized learning has long been recognized as
an effective approach to cater to the diverse needs and preferences of
learners. GAI's ability to analyze extensive amounts of data and adapt to
individual learning styles offers unprecedented opportunities for customized
instruction. By employing sophisticated algorithms and machine learning
techniques, GAI can assess learners' strengths, weaknesses, and learning
patterns, enabling the development of tailored curricula and adaptive learning
pathways.
The integration of GAI as a personal intelligent
tutor goes beyond the mere delivery of content. It encompasses a range of
interactive features that enhance the learning experience. GAI can engage
learners through conversational interfaces, simulating human-like interactions
and fostering a supportive learning environment. Moreover, GAI's continuous
monitoring and assessment capabilities enable real-time feedback, swiftly
identifying misconceptions and providing targeted interventions to address
learning gaps.
