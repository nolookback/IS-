报告摘要：
In this lecture, applications of the
theory of cyclostationarity  to
communications and radar/sonar are presented. The following problems will be
addressed: Wiener filtering, synchronization,
signal parameter and waveform estimation, channel identification and
equalization, signal detection, cycle frequency estimation, modulation format
classification.
