报告摘要：
Recently, deep learning has achieved promising results in a number of computer vision tasks such as object detection, medical image analysis, etc. State-of-the-art CNNs (convolutional neural networks) usually have many parameters requiring massive amounts of data to train from scratch, whereas the existing visual quality assessment datasets are usually small due to assessing the quality of a very large number of stimuli in a lab setting would require too many participants and too much time for preparing and running the experiment. In this talk, I will give a brief introduction how we designed a reliable and efficient framework for conducting subjective visual quality assessment via crowdsourcing, based on that a few large-scale benchmarking datasets have been created for various visual quality assessment tasks, such as image/video quality assessment and just noticeable difference for image compression.
