Morphology Tuning of Bulk-heterojunction Organic Solar Cells
Speaker Dr. Tao LIU
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
About the Speaker
Dr. Liu graduated from Beihang University in 2017, then joined the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and continued to study organic photovoltaic materials and devices. He is the highly cited researchers of Clarivate in 2019 and 2020, and 1% RSC highly cited scientist.
Talk Introduction
The speaker will mainly introduce the two core issues of organic solar cell material design and active layer morphology control from fullerenes, non-fullerenes, and ternary devices. Aiming at the problems of difficult active layer morphology control and low device fill factor, the material design idea of using alkyl side chains and asymmetric end groups is proposed, and the preparation strategy of a new type of ternary blend device is proposed, which provides an effective means to solve the core problem, and obtains compactness in multiple organic solar cell systems. The interpenetrating network fibrous morphology and high fill factor significantly improve the efficiency of the device.
