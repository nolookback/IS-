Exploring microbial interactions in marine ecosystems
Speaker  Dr. Yang LIU
Shenzhen University
About the Speaker
Dr. Yang Liu, an associated research fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study of Shenzhen University. He received his Ph.D. degree in functional ecology from University of Toulouse III, France in 2016. He has published 31 papers in journals such as Nature, including 9 papers as the first/co-first author.
Talk Introduction
Microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, archaea, and protists, do not exist in isolation but form complex ecological interaction webs in the natural environments. Microbial interactions are crucial for a successful establishment and maintenance of a microbial community in ecosystems. These interactions occur by environmental recognition followed by transference of molecular and genetic information, including many mechanisms. Most of the microbial interaction relationships were studied by cultured species and allow scientists to observe under microscopes and various physiological manipulations. However, 99% of microorganisms have not been cultured yet. Metagenomics techniques generate tons of data that should capture the genetic information of various dimensions of the microbial world, including their mutual relationships. My research goals are first to explore and understand novel microbial interactions hidden in the microbial dark matters through a data-driven and question-driven combined approach and contribute to both the theory of microbial evolution and the practice of microbial applications.
