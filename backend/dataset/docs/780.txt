报告摘要：
A survey or review paper has become increasingly
more important as it serves as a comprehensive source of preliminary literature
review and rich references for researchers. In this presentation, a gentle
introduction to writing a survey and review paper will be given, specifically
from the data communications and networking perspective. First, the
presentation highlights the nature, importance, and impact of the survey paper.
Then, we discuss typical steps in preparing a survey paper. The presentation
outlines a few tips to improve the survey paper preparation. Finally, the presentation
provides a brief overview of IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials (COMST).
