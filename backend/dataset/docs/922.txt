Identification and Control of Nonlinear Discrete-time Uncertain Systems
Speaker Dr. Zhaobo LIU
College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University
About the Speaker
Dr. Liu received his B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from Peking University in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory from the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2020. He is now a Postdoctoral Fellow in the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering of Shenzhen University.
Talk Introduction
The talk includes the self-tuning regulator problems of discrete-time nonlinear uncertain systems and the parameter identification of the general nonlinear autoregressive model. Firstly, for the scalar parameter case, we find that it is possible to stabilize a system growing exponential fast as long as the density of the regular set is not 0. Moreover, we establish a logarithmic law on the density of the regular set for scalar parameter systems to describe the feedback limitations. Specifically, for a typical family of functions, we obtain a new critical constant 2 to determine the stabilizability. Further, to study the multi-parameter case with self-tuning regulators, we establish the asymptotic theorem for the least-square algorithm of the general nonlinear autoregressive model and an appropriate excitation condition for the corresponding closed-loop system identification. Finally, we overcome the difficulties of verifying excitation conditions and deduce stabilizability theorems for two kinds of basic discrete-time multi-parameter uncertain systems..
