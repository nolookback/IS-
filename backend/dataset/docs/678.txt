报告人简介：
Dr. Cui is a Senior Research Scientist at the Guelph Research and Development Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Adjunct Professor at the University of Guelph (Canada), Nanchang University and Jiangnan University (China). Dr. Cui’s expertise includes structure and functional studies of natural hydrocolloids and bioactive polysaccharides from agricultural products; processing and applications of dietary fibre and dietary fibre analysis. Dr. Cui has developed patented technologies for value added processing of Canadian crops for producing functional food products and bio-products.
Dr. Cui is Editor-in-Chief of Bioactive Carbohydrates and Dietary Fibre (Elsevier),Chair of the International Hydrocolloids Conferences and chaired co-chaired the 2002, 2016 and 2022 (Co-Chaired with Professor Doug Goff) IHC at Guelph, Canada. He has published over 300 peer reviewed papers and authored/edited four books: Polysaccharide Gums from Agricultural Products (CRC Press, 2000), Food Carbohydrates (CRC Press, 2005), Bioactive Polysaccharides (Elsevier, 2017; Co-Author) and Methodology for Structural Analysis of Polysaccharides (Springers, 2019; Co-author). Dr. Cui was Managing Guest Editor for the following journals: Food Hydrocolloids (from 2002 to 2022, 6 issues), Food Research International (Editor and Managing Guest Editor, 2009 to 2012), Trends in Food Science and Technology (Guest Editor, 2003). Dr. Cui was winner of the 2018 Food Hydrocolloids Trust Medal, and was recipient of Prize of Outstanding Achievement Award in Science (AAFC, 2021). He also received  the Science Mobility Award by the French Government to present lectures at Grenoble University, Centre de Recherche sur les Macromolécules Végétales (CRMV) and Roquette Company in France. He is Chair of the Science Advisory Board of newly formed CIFST-Food Cluster in Canada (2023-2028).
Dr. Cui graduated from Peking University, China with a B.Sc. degree in 1983, from Jiangnan University (Wuxi, China) with a M.Sc. degree in 1986, and from the University of Manitoba (Winnipeg, Manitoba) with a Ph.D. degree in 1993 specialized in Carbohydrate Chemistry and Rheology.
讲座摘要
：
Plant polysaccharides are widely present in agricultural products which have been systematically studied in our lab, including flaxseed gum, cereal beta-D-glucans, yellow mustard gum and psyllium husk polysaccharides. We used traditional methylation analysis techniques combined with GC-MS, 2D NMR spectroscopies to elucidate the detailed structures of those polysaccharides in order to understand their functional properties. These polysaccharides have been characterized for their molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, rheological properties and emulsification properties. Some of the health benefits are also demonstrated when they were added into food products. Examples will be given for their applications in novel foods which is in high demand in North America.
