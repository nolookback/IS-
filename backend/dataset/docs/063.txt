讲座简介：
Childhood represents a pivotal stage of
development, bridging early years to adolescence. Orphans, particularly those
lacking social support, are at higher risk of experiencing depression and
emotional difficulties. Emotional literacy plays a critical role in managing
feelings, fostering empathy, and supporting overall psychological well-being.
This study aimed to enhance emotional literacy and well-being among
institutionalized children in Malaysia through a quasi-experimental
intervention without randomization. A total of 67 children participated, with
30 assigned to the intervention group and 37 to the control group.
Pre-evaluation data were collected prior to the intervention, followed by a
post-evaluation upon its completion. A self-administered questionnaire assessed
emotional literacy and psychological well-being.
The intervention consisted of eight weekly
sessions, each lasting one to two hours, focusing on themes such as managing
and expressing emotions, self-motivation, empathy, kindness, and relationship
skills. Activities included mindfulness, role-playing, art, games, Q&A
sessions, and group discussions. Findings revealed significant improvements in
emotional literacy and psychological well-being within the intervention group.
However, between-group comparisons did not show statistically significant
differences. These results highlight the urgent need to address mental health
among children and adolescents in institutional settings. Dismantling the
stigma surrounding mental health in Malaysia, particularly in educational and
care environments, is essential to ensuring more effective support and
interventions.
