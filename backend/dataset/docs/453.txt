报告人简介：
Sujong Chae is an assistant professor in the department of industrial chemistry at Pukyong national university. He achieved his doctoral degree in Energy and Chemical Engineering from UNIST, South Korea (2019). During the course of his Ph. D. studies, his research was primarily focused on advancing the practical implementation of Si anode for high-energy lithium ion batteries (LIB). Subsequent to completing his Ph.D., he joined the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) as a postdoctoral research associate under the supervision of Dr. Ji-Guang Zhang and Dr. Xiaolin Li (2019-2021). His current research interests encompass the gas phase synthesis for high-energy LIB, Si anode for all solid-state batteries (ASSB) and the current collector engineering.
