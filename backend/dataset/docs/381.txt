Abstract
:
The sensor motion effect when performing
localization of an object by monostatic sensor has often been neglected.
Modern sensor platforms are dynamic and can
move at high speeds, making the assumption invalid especially for underwater
localization.
This talk presents some
recent progress on investigating the performance lost due to the ignorance of
sensor motion, for locating an object by time delay and Doppler shifted
frequencies.
In particular, we derive
the new measurement models by considering the sensor motion effect, analyze the
model bias when ignoring the motion effect and develop localization algorithm
using the new measurement models that can reach the CRLB performance.
Insight on the localization geometries where
the sensor motion effect is more significant will also be discussed.

Biography
:
Dr. Ho received the BSc degree
with First Class Honors and the PhD degree in Electronic Engineering, both from
the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
He
was a research associate at the Royal Military College of Canada, a member of
scientific staff at the Bell-Northern Research, and a faculty at the University
of Saskatchewan, Canada.
Since 1997, he
has been with the University of Missouri, where he is a professor in the
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department.
His research interests are in sensor array
processing, source localization, subsurface object detection, and wireless
communications.
Dr. Ho has been active
in the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) standard developments
between 1995 and 2012.
He was the
rapporteur of one recommendation and the editor of several others.
Dr. Ho was an Associate Editor of the IEEE
Transactions of Signal Processing (2003-2006, 2009-2013) and the IEEE Signal
Processing Letters (2004-2008).
He served
as the Chair of the IEEE Sensor Array Multichannel (SAM) Technical Committee
from 2013 to 2014 and the Past Chair in 2015.
He was Technical Co-Chair of the IEEE International Conference on
Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) held in Shanghai, in 2016.
He is an inventor of 22 patents in the United
States, Canada, Europe and Asia on geolocation and signal processing for
wireless communications.
Dr. Ho is a
fellow of the IEEE.
