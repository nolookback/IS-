Native MS: a versatile tool to study biomolecular interactions
Speaker Dr. Hoi Kin Kuan
University of Oxford, UK
About the Speaker
Dr. Hoi conducted his DPhil research and postdoctoral research in Professor Dame Carol Robinson’s lab, Oxford University. His research interests focus on the regulation of GPCR functions, in particular the effect of the lipid environment, and the application of different membrane mimetics in native MS.
Talk Introduction
Using native mass spectrometry (MS), intact proteins can be transmitted into the gas-phase while preserving their folding and non-covalent interactions. Attributed to the high resolution of modern mass spectrometers, it is possible to analyze heterogeneous mixtures as well as complex microstates of proteins. Native mass spectrometry, therefore, provides a powerful tool to investigate protein complexes, post-translation modifications (PTMs), and ligand/lipid interactions. Here, I will discuss how we used native MS in combination with other biophysical tools to characterize structurally and functionally important lipids of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the major targets in the drug market. Our results reveal a novel role of lipids in the regulation of GPCR signaling and therefore the therapeutic implication of lipid-like molecules. In addition, I will discuss the application of Nanodiscs and Lipodisqs in native MS, and reveal the gas-phase behavior of these membrane mimetics and the analytical strategies developed.
