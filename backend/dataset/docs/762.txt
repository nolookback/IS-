Abstract
）
：
Antenna is the most historical wireless
device technology. The antenna technology has experinced many revolutionary
step with the fast development of wireless systems. The antenna technology has
directly and significantly contributed to the enhancement of capacity of
wireless systems as well. The antenna technology is facing revolutionary
innovation for future wireless systems. This talk will briefly review the
history, milestone development, and impact of antenna technology. Then the
challenges and development trends of antenna technology will be addressed. The
talk will end with updating the success stories of new antenna technology such
as metantennas and the applications of a machine-learning based synthesis
method to metalens antennas.
个人简历（
BIO
）：
Zhi Ning Chen (Fellow IEEE
，
2007) received the B.Eng., M.Eng., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical
engineering from the Institute of Communications Engineering (ICE), Nanjing,
China, in 1985, 1988, and 1993, respectively, and the second Ph.D. degree from
the University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan, in 2003. From 1988 to 1995, he
worked as a Lecturer and later an Associate Professor with ICE and a
Post-Doctoral Fellow and later an Associate Professor with Southeast
University, Nanjing. From 1995 to 1997, he joined the City University of Hong
Kong, Hong Kong, as a Research Assistant and later a Research Fellow. In 1997,
he was awarded the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Fellowship
to conduct his research at the University of Tsukuba. From 1999 to 2016, he
worked with the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), Singapore, as a
Principal Scientist, the Head of the RF and Optical Department, and a Technical
Advisor. In 2012, he joined the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, as a tenured Full
Professor, where he is currently the Program Director (Industry). He is
holding/held the concurrent guest professorships at Southeast University
(Changjiang Chair Professor); Nanjing University, Nanjing; Tsinghua University,
Beijing, China; Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China; Tongji
University, Shanghai; the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei,
China; Fudan University (Outstanding Visiting Professor), Shanghai; Dalian
Maritime University, Dalian, China; Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; the
National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, Shanghai
University (Ziqiang Professor), Shanghai; the Beijing University of Posts and
Telecommunications, Tohoku University, Beijing; and the City University of Hong
Kong (Adjunct Professor), Hong Kong. He is also serving as the members of State
Key Laboratory of Millimeter-waves, Southeast University, and the City
University of Hong Kong. He is interested in electromagnetic engineering and
antennas/sensors for communication, radar, imaging, and sensing systems. He has
published more than 660 academic papers and five books entitled Broadband
Planar Antennas (Wiley 2005), UWB Wireless Communication (Wiley 2006), Antennas
for Portable Devices (Wiley 2007), Antennas for Base Stations in Wireless
Communications (McGraw-Hill 2009), and Handbook of Antenna Technologies with 76
chapters (by Springer References in 2016 as an Editor-in-Chief). He has also
contributed the chapters to the books entitled UWB Antennas and Propagation for
Communications, Radar, and Imaging (Wiley 2006), Antenna Engineering Handbook
(McGraw-Hill 2007), Microstrip and Printed Antennas (Wiley 2010), and
Electromagnetics of Body Area Networks (Wiley 2016). He is holding 28 granted/
filed patents with 35 licensed deals with industry. Dr. Chen was elevated to a
fellow of the IEEE for the contribution to small and broadband antennas for
wireless applications in 2007. He was elevated to a Fellow of the Academy of
Engineering Singapore in 2019. He was a recipient of the International
Symposium on Antennas and Propagation Best Paper Award 2010, the CST University
Publication Awards 2008 and 2015, the ASEAN Outstanding Engineering Achievement
Award in 2013, the Institution of Engineers Singapore Prestigious Engineering
Achievement Awards 2006, 2013(2), and 2014, the I2R Quarterly Best Paper Award
2004, the IEEE iWAT 2005 Best Poster Award, several technology achievement
awards from China during 1990 to 1997, as well as more than 19 academic awards
by the students he supervised. He is the Founding General Chair of the
International Workshop on Antenna Technology (iWAT in 2005), the International
Symposium on InfoComm and Mechatronics Technology in Bio-Medical and Healthcare
Application (IS 3Tin3A in 2010), the International Microwave Forum (IMWF in
2010), and the Asia–Pacific Conference on Antennas and Propagation (APCAP in
2012). He also involved in many international events as the General Chair, the
Chair, and a member for technical program committees and international advisory
committees. He has served IEEE Council on RFID as a Vice President and a
Distinguished Lecturer since 2015. He served on the IEEE TRANSACTION ON
ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION as an Associate Editor and the IEEE Antennas and
Propagation Society as a Distinguished Lecturer. In 2021, Prof. Chen
obtained
John
Kraus Antenna Award
for
outstanding contributions to translational research of electromagnetic
metamaterials for antenna engineering.
