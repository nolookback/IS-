报告人简介：
The Chi laboratory is committed to the state-of-art original chemistry research that addresses problems of both fundamental and practical significance. A key objective is to develop green and efficient synthetic methods to make functional molecules, and to understand the principles guiding the bong breaking and formation events. For the past ten years, the Chi lab has developed new activation modes and synthetic transformations enabled by N-Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) as the key organic catalyst. In the years to come, the Chi lab is moving beyond methodology development and laboratory scale chemical synthesis. Examples of current projects include chemo-selective reactions for biomolecules and their analogous (such as saccharides), antibacterial and antiviral agricultural chemicals, medicinal molecules and prodrugs, ultra-efficient reactions, green process for industrial scale applications, and applied research for innovation and entrepreneurship

讲座摘要：
This is a general lecture with undergraduate/graduate students as the main target audience. The historical development and possible future perspectives of organic catalysis will be briefly discussed, with a few case studies offered. Students are expected to be challenged with chemistry questions including but not limited to reaction mechanisms. Bring a pen and a piece of paper with you
