Abstract
:
A fundamental limitation of localization is
that we are able to locate an object by direction of arrival only if
it is in the far-field, instead of the precise point coordinates when it
is in the near-field.
This talk
introduces the concept of transceiver-aided localization, breaking through the
barrier in locating a far-field object in coordinates rather than direction of
arrival only.
The transceivers bridge
between the sensors and the far-field object, which acts as a relay so that the
probing signal can reach the object and return back to the sensors.
The minimum number of sensors and
transceivers for localization is derived.
While we do not know the position and velocity of the transceivers, we
show that we are able to perform joint estimation with the transceiver
parameters to locate the object.
Simulation validates the theory and demonstrates the feasibility of the
transceiver-based localization approach.

Biography
:
Dr. Ho was born in Hong
Kong.  He received the BSc degree with
First Class Honors and the PhD degree in Electronic Engineering, both from the
Chinese University of Hong Kong.  He was
a research associate at the Royal Military College of Canada, a member of
scientific staff at the Bell-Northern Research, and a faculty at the University
of Saskatchewan, Canada.  Since 1997, he
has been with the University of Missouri, where he is a professor in the
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department.  His research interests are in sensor array
processing, source localization, subsurface object detection, and wireless
communications.  Dr. Ho has been active
in the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) standard developments
between 1995 and 2012.  He was the
rapporteur of one recommendation and the editor of several others.  Dr. Ho was an Associate Editor of the IEEE
Transactions of Signal Processing (2003-2006, 2009-2013) and the IEEE Signal
Processing Letters (2004-2008).  He
served as the Chair of the IEEE Sensor Array Multichannel (SAM) Technical
Committee from 2013 to 2014 and the Past Chair in 2015.  He was Technical Co-Chair of the IEEE
International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)
held in Shanghai, in 2016.  He is an
inventor of 44 patents in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia on
geolocation and signal processing for wireless communications.  Dr. Ho is a fellow of the IEEE.
