讲座主要内容：
Policymakers and researchers have concerns that the expected credit loss (ECL) approach may exacerbate the procyclicality when the economic crisis is unexpected. Using administrative loan-level data in China, we nd that banks adopting the ECL model reduced their credit supplies and became more prudent in lending decisions after the unexpected COVID-19 outbreak, compared with banks using the incurred credit loss (ICL) approach. Our ndings are more pronounced for the banks that experienced greater loan loss provisions induced by ECL. The credit crunch is potentially long-lasting. We further document the negative externality of ECL during the recession period on the borrowing rms. These ndings support the conjecture that ECL may exacerbate
the procyclicality during unexpected economic crises.
