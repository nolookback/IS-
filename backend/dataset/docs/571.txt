讲座摘要
：
The renaissance of liquid metals has created unprecedented opportunities for broad disciplines intersecting materials science, engineering, advanced manufacturing, and nanotechnology. This is particularly true when it comes to the synthesis of strategically important metal fine structures that are backbones of numerous cutting-edge technologies. Recently, we have demonstrated that liquid metals can be used as special metallic synthesis solvents for renovating metal material design. In this seminar, I will talk about my research revolving around liquid metal-based crystal synthesis. I will touch on the unique metal-metal interactions and surface/interface critical phenomena that stimulate the structural development in liquid metal systems. The synthesis methods, distinguishing features, and potential applications of liquid metal-grown crystals will be discussed. This focused case study is meant to serve as one exemplar to showcase the great potential of liquid metals for driving material innovations and technological advancements.
