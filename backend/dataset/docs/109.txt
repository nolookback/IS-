讲座摘要：
The force-flux relationship is a fundamental concept in explaining mass transport under a driving force in non-equilibrium conditions. This relationship is captured by the Onsager relation, which describes how gradients in concentration, temperature, and voltage drive the transport of mass, heat, and charge, while also considering cross-effects. In this presentation, I will explore how ion transport driven by a voltage gradient varies depending on the diffusion medium, and how this transport can be harnessed in various technological applications. Specifically, I will focus on layered materials with van der Waals gaps, which facilitate ion movement along pathways with low diffusion energy barriers. These materials hold significant potential in semiconductors, metals, and insulators, where they could serve as memory devices, switching devices, and ion-sieving membranes.
