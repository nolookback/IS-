主题：
Master Narratives in Developmental Dating Trajectories Among Young Adults in the United States
摘要：
Emerging adulthood is the time period between 18-30 years old that is comprised of unique developmental features. As we gain further insights into the dynamic and complex pathways between adolescence and adulthood, there is a continued need to examine emerging adults’ successes and struggles in a variety of domains of development. One of these domains is the area of dating and romantic relationships, which is particularly salient during this developmental period given that exploration in this domain is increasingly sanctioned over this extended period of time. This talk will provide an overview of central aspects of emerging adult development, how dating relationships manifest during this time period, and the ways in which cultural master narratives shape and define expectations within the dating and romantic relationship realm for emerging adults in the United States.

主题：
Hierarchical MPFC function for social valuation
摘要：
The medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) has long been recognized as the key component of the neurocircuitry involved in various social as well as non-social behaviors; however, little is known regarding the organizing principle of distinctive subregions in the MPFC that integrates a wide range of MPFC functions. In the present lecture, I will introduce several recent studies from my lab that investigated the neural mechanisms of various social behaviors such as moral decision-making, altruistic behavior, impression management, and self-protection. At the end of the lecture, I will propose a hierarchical model of MPFC functionality, where three functionally dissociable subregions, namely, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), rostromedial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC), and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), are differentially involved in computing values of decision-making under various social situations. According to this model, the MPFC subregions interact with each other in such a way that more dorsal regions utilize additional external sensory information from environment to predict and prevent conflicts occurring in more ventral regions tuned to internal bodily signals, thereby exerting the hierarchically organized allostatic regulatory control over homeostatic reflexes. The hierarchical architecture of the MPFC may play a key role in adjusting the internal (bodily) needs to suit the constraints of external (environmental) variables better; thus, effectively addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma.

主题：
Psychology of Sport Injury
摘要：
Injuries sustained during sport and physical activity are a substantial public health issue, both in China and around the world. Although physical factors have traditionally been emphasized in the study of the occurrence of and recovery from sport injury, psychological factors are relevant to all aspects of sport injury and have been examined extensively. In this presentation, a variety of psychological aspects of sport injury will be discussed, including: (a) psychosocial antecedents of sport injury; (b) psychological interventions to prevent or reduce the occurrence of sport injuries; (c) psychological responses to sport injury; (d) adherence to sport injury rehabilitation regimens; (e) psychological factors associated with sport injury rehabilitation outcomes; and (f) psychological interventions in sport injury rehabilitation. Attention will be given to psychological theory, research, and practice pertaining to sport injury.
