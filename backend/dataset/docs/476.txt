摘要：
Far-field channel model has been considered for decades
in wireless communications. However, as ultra-massive MIMO is promising for
future wireless communications with high frequency such as millimeter wave and
TeraHz, near-field channel model becomes important. In this talk, near-field
channel model and latest research results in UM-MIMO will be presented.
