Abstract:
Robust estimation and sparse regularization are involved in many scientific and engineering problems. The former is required when there are outliers or impulsive disturbances in the observed data, while the latter is a standard technique for handling sparse recovery, namely, finding a solution with the minimum number of nonzero entries in a certain domain. In this talk, the connection between robust estimation and sparse regularization will be revealed, and a new framework for a robust loss function will be presented to address these two topics. Application examples of robust factorization based and rank minimization based matrix recovery are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

raphy:
 Hing Cheung So (S’90–M’95–SM’07-F’15) was born in
Hong Kong. He received the B.Eng. degree from the
City University of Hong Kong and the Ph.D. degree
from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, both
in electronic engineering, in 1990 and 1995,
respectively.
From 1990 to 1991, he was an Electronic Engineer
with the Research and Development Division, Everex
Systems Engineering Ltd., Hong Kong. During
1995-1996, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with The
Chinese University of Hong Kong. From 1996 to
1999, he was a Research Assistant Professor with the Department of Electronic
Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, where he is currently a
Professor. His research interests include detection and estimation, fast and adaptive algorithms, multidimensional harmonic retrieval, robust signal processing, source localization, and sparse approximation.
He has been on the editorial boards of
IEEE Signal Processing Magazine
 (2014-2017),
IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
 (2010-2014),
Signal Processing
 (2010-), and
Digital Signal Processing
 (2011-). He was also Lead Guest Editor for
IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing
, special issue on
“
Advances in Time/Frequency Modulated Array Signal Processing” in 2017. In addition, he was an elected member in
Signal Processing Theory and Methods Technical Committee
 (2011-2016) of the IEEE Signal Processing Society where he was chair in the awards subcommittee (2015-2016).
