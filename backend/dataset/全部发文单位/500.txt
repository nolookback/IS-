报告摘要：
In this lecture, an overview on
cyclostationary processes is presented. Cyclostationary processes have
statistical functions (distribution function, autocorrelation, moments,
cumulants) that are periodic functions of time. They arise from the interaction
of periodic phenomena with random ones. In communications, periodicity is due
to carriers and pulse trains and randomness is due to modulating data or
propagation and scattering phenomena. Other fields of application include
mechanical systems, econometrics, radio astronomy, biology, and
neuroscience.  In the lecture, the problems
of statistical characterization, linear filtering, sampling, and statistical
function estimation are addressed.
