讲座摘要
：
In this talk, I am going to summarize our recent progresses towards design of efficient oxygen electrocatalysts for various electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications. The design strategies include: 1. How to experimentally determine binding strength of reactive intermediates. 2. How to tune binding strength of reactive intermediates by surface engineering. 3. How to break the scaling relationship.
