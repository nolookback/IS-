讲座摘要
:
Antennas play a pivotal role in wireless communication and radar systems. While
advanced simulation tools facilitate antenna design, the post-fabrication
assessment of their performance is equally crucial, yet often overlooked in
standard university education. This oversight becomes even more critical as we
transition towards 6G technology, where product time-to-market and reputation
are paramount.
In this talk,
we delve into the significance of radiation efficiency as the ultimate
performance metric for antennas and mobile devices. We begin by introducing and
comparing existing measurement methods, such as the directivity/gain,
integration, Wheeler cap, calorimetric, and reverberation methods.
Subsequently, we unveil two innovative approaches, the source-stirred
cap/chamber, and TEM cell methods, aimed at delivering cost-effective, swift,
and accurate evaluation methods.
Our discussion
extends to the underlying theories behind these emerging technologies,
equipping you with the latest insights into this dynamic and challenging field.
Join us as we explore the frontiers of efficient antenna and mobile device
evaluation, shaping the landscape of next-generation wireless communications
and radar systems.
报告人简介：
Yi Huang
(Fellow, IEEE) received BSc in Physics (Wuhan, China) in 1984, MSc (Eng) in
Microwave Engineering (Nanjing, China) in 1987, and DPhil in Communications
from the University of Oxford, UK in 1994.
He has been conducting research in the areas of
antennas, wireless communications, applied electromagnetics, radar, and EMC
since 1987. More recently, he has focused on new materials for antennas,
wireless energy harvesting, and power transfer. His experience includes 3 years
spent with NRIET (
China
) as
a
Radar Engineer
 and various periods
with the Universities of Birmingham,
Oxford
, and
Essex in the
UK
as a member of research staff. He worked as a
Research Fellow
 at British Telecom Labs in 1994 and then
joined
the Department of Electrical Engineering & Electronics, the
University of Liverpool
, UK as a
Faculty
in 1995, where he is now a full
Professor in Wireless Engineering
, the
Head of High-Frequency Engineering Group
.
Prof
Huang has published over
50
0 refereed papers in leading international journals
and conference proceedings and author
ed
four books, including
Antennas: from Theory to Practice
 (John Wiley, 2008
and 2021)
. He has received many
patents,
 and research grants from research councils,
government agencies, charities, the EU, and industry,
and
is a recipient of over 10 awards (e.g. EuCAP2023 Best Antenna Paper, IET
Premium Award for Best Papers 2022, IET Innovation Award 2018, and BAE Systems
Chairman’s Award 2017). He
has
served on a number of
national and international technical committees and has been an
Editor, Associate Editor, or Guest Editor
of
seven
international journals
 (including IEEE TAP
2022-date, IEEE AWPL 2016-2022)
.
In addition, he
has been a
keynote/invited speaker
and
organiser
of many conferences and
workshops (e.g. IEEE iWAT2010, LAPC2012,
UCMMT2017/2023, and EuCAP2018/2024
).
He
is at present the
Editor-in-Chief
 of
Wireless Engineering and Technology
,
the
UK
and Ir
e
land Rep
 to the European
Association
of Antenna and Propagation (EurAAP, 2016-2020, 2022-date),
a
Fellow
of IET
, a
Fellow
 of IEEE, and a
Distinguished
Lecturer
 of IEEE AP-S (2022-2025)
