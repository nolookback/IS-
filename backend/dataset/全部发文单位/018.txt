简介：
Prof. Daniel Mirman is a Professor of Brain and Language at the University of Edinburgh, UK, where he leads cutting-edge research at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience, psycholinguistics, and clinical neuropsychology. He earned his Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience from Carnegie Mellon University and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, followed by postdoctoral training at the University of Connecticut and Haskins Laboratories.
Prof. Mirman’s work focuses on the neural and computational mechanisms of language comprehension, semantic cognition, and post-stroke aphasia. His lab employs advanced methodologies, including lesion-symptom mapping, intracranial EEG, and behavioral experiments, to unravel how the brain processes meaning, represents concepts, and adapts after injury. Notably, his research has illuminated the roles of taxonomic vs. thematic semantic systems, the dynamics of spoken word comprehension, and the neuroanatomical basis of language deficits.
He has published extensively in top-tier journals such as the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Nature Communications, Psychological Review, and Journal of Experimental Psychology: General et al. He also serves as Editor-in-Chief of Psychonomic Bulletin & Review and has held editorial roles at Cognitive Science, Cortex, and PLOS ONE. Prof. Mirman is also dedicated to developing research tools for psychology and neuroscience. His work bridges theoretical insights with clinical applications, advancing our understanding of brain-language relationships and rehabilitation strategies.
