Abstract
Cell cycle is tightly regulated to maintain
normal cell function and proliferation. Cell cycle defects, resulted from
endogenous or exogenous stresses, may lead to genome instability which is
believed to be a driving force of tumorigenesis and cancer genome evolution.
Genome instability and genome evolution is the key for cancer therapy and drug
resistance. However, it remains elusive the form(s), the underlying mechanism
and the consequences of genome instability. My group uses a combination of
cutting-edge techniques such as in vitro biochemical reconstitution, genome
engineering, high-throughput live cell imaging, high-resolution mass
spectrometry and so forth, to address how cells coordinate growth and division
under normal and pathological conditions. In combination with multiple models
such as mammalian cell line, knockout mouse, and xenograft, we study the impact
of cell cycle defects on genome stability. We have discovered some new
phenomenon of genome instability and revealed the underlying molecular
mechanisms. These findings greatly deepen our understanding of cell cycle and
cancer genome evolution.

：
Dr. Lin Deng is a Principle Investigator
(P.I.) at Shenzhen Bay Laboratory since 2020. He got his Ph.D. degree in Biochemistry
from Dartmouth College in 2015, and received his postdoctoral training at
Harvard Medical School from 2015 to 2020. His research interest is mainly
focused on cell cycle regulation and genome instability. So far, he has
published about 40 papers in journals like Molecular Cell, Current Biology, Nature,
Nature Communications and so forth. He received honors including the 2014
Thomas-Copenhaver Fellow of Dartmouth College, 2015 E. Lucile Smith Award for
Excellence in Biochemistry of Dartmouth Medical School, and 2020 Shenzhen
High-Caliber Personnel.
