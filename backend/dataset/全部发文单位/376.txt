Abstract:
Machine learning, particularly distributed learning, stands as the
cornerstone in the vision of future network intelligence, owing to its
remarkable capability of addressing intricate computational tasks and modeling
complexities. In this talk, we provide a comprehensive coverage of a
distributed learning paradigm rooted in federated learning. Specifically, we
start with a brief overview of federated learning and some recent advances in
this topic.
