摘要：
Driver
distraction poses a significant threat to road safety, demanding effective
detection and mitigation strategies. Our work presents a comprehensive review
of advancements in multimodal driver distraction detection systems, analyzing
key components and deployment considerations. We delve into the various
simulators and sensors employed, including their strengths and limitations in
capturing driver behavior. A thorough examination of detection algorithms is
conducted, covering traditional methods like Support Vector Machines and more
recent deep learning approaches, highlighting their efficacy and computational
demands. The paper further explores the diverse multimodal data sources, such
as visual, auditory, and physiological signals, and investigates different
feature fusion techniques to enhance detection accuracy. System evaluation
metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, are discussed alongside the
importance of establishing standardized distraction metrics for objective
performance assessment. We analyze the practical aspects of deploying these
systems, considering factors like cost, computational resources, and real-time
processing capabilities. Additionally, we count patents and existing real-world
applications, then explore potential applications of driver distraction
detection systems beyond individual vehicles, such as in fleet management and
driver training programs. Finally, we discuss the current market landscape and
future directions for research and development, emphasizing the need for
robust, generalizable, and ethically sound solutions.
