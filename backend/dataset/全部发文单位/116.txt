摘要
:
With the rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices,
human activity and location sensing technologies have become increasingly
essential across various fields, including human-computer interaction, smart
cities, health monitoring, and security systems. However, current approaches
face significant challenges: WiFi-based localization is highly dependent on the
distribution of Access Points (APs), while Inertial Measurement Unit
(IMU)-based methods often suffer from cumulative errors and drift over time. To
address these issues, advanced encoding techniques and activity-based methods
have been employed to ensure reliable localization performance
.
First, a Siamese Network is utilized to
encode WiFi signals, allowing the system to maintain accurate localization even
when certain APs are removed or relocated over time. Second, IMU-based human
activity recognition technology is leveraged to identify human activities
without raising privacy concerns. These recognized activities are then linked
to specific landmarks, which can be used to optimize localization accuracy.
Additionally, the application of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) is explored,
highlighting their potential for energy-efficient and biologically inspired
processing in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.
Finally, we conclude by discussing future
opportunities and unresolved challenges in the field, such as improving
robustness, achieving greater scalability, and integrating multi-modal sensing
techniques to further enhance system performance.
