摘要：
Many industrial processes
operate continuously batch by batch. During online operation, predicting the
plant output is needed for monitoring and control of the industrial process. The
predictor model can be constructed from historical plant operational data. But
during the plant operation, the underlying process characteristics change, and
the predictor model must adapt in order to track the plant’s time-varying
characteristics, which requires the actual process output as desired target.
However, the process output measurement for these batch-by-batch streaming
processes is typically seriously delayed. Without the timely process output
measurement, applying standard adaptive algorithms to adapt the predictor model
is impossible. How to address this challenge motivates this work.
