报告人简介：
Yujie Sun (
孙宇杰
) received a B.S. degree in Chemistry from Fudan University in 2005. He then pursued graduate studies in inorganic photochemistry with Prof. Claudia Turro at The Ohio State University and obtained his Ph.D. degree in 2010. After a postdoctoral training in the group of Prof. Christopher J. Chang at UC Berkeley, Yujie started his independent career as an Assistant Professor at Utah State University in 2013, moved to the University of Cincinnati as an Associate Professor in 2018, and was promoted to Professor in 2023. His group is interested in developing and understanding inexpensive materials and complexes for energy catalysis and biomedical applications

讲座摘要：
Exploring renewable carbon and energy resources is essential for our sustainable development. Biomass, as the most abundant renewable carbon source, and solar energy, as a clean and inexhaustible energy source, offer promising avenues for advancement. Our research focuses on developing novel electrochemical and photochemical systems to maximize the efficient utilization of biomass and solar energy. This presentation will highlight our recent achievements, including hybrid electrocatalytic systems for biomass valorization via bipolar hydrogenation and two-photon-absorbing photocatalysts designed for diverse organic transformations under red and near-infrared light irradiation.
