摘要：
This seminar explores the adoption of UAV swarm
technology in future environments. With the continuous development of UAV
autonomy and networked communication technologies. In the battlefield UAVs are
widely used in coordinated missions for long term surveillance, decoys and
tracking strikes against targets, thus the effectiveness of UAV swarm in
military operations is widely recognized. Its great potential has also driven
the exploration of UAV swarm in various civil domains, where they play a
crucial role in accelerating the development of various smart city applications
such as transportation, surveillance, security, critical infrastructure
monitoring, networking and disaster relief. Therefore, UAV swarm technology is
also an indispensable part of sustainable urban development.
This seminar first demonstrates the research and
application of UAV swarm technology in military environments, examining how UAV
swarms can perform collaborative missions. Then the seminar discusses and
demonstrates the possible application scenarios of UAV swarm technology in
different smart cities, and analyzes the development and challenges involved in
detail.
