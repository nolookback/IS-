讲座摘要
：
Gallium-based liquid metals are an appealing conductor for soft and stretchable devices due to their metallic conductivity while they are strained. The liquid metals spontaneously form the thin oxide layer (~3 nm) upon exposure to the oxygen. This oxide layer allows the metal to adhere to various substrates and to stabilize the shape in the air. Thus, the liquid metal can be patterned into the desired geometries by unconventional methods including capillary injection, printing, molding and forced wetting. By utilizing elastic substrates patterned with the liquid metal, we have recently demonstrated various applications such as stretchable shape memory polymers with electrical conductivity, thermo- and mechanochromic fibers, stretchable sensors, smart textiles, electromagnetic interference shielding and energy harvesting devices. In this presentation, we will discuss that recent emerging applications of the gallium-based liquid metals.
