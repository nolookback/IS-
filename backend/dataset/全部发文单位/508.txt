摘要：
This seminar explores the adoption of blockchain
technology for cross-border e-commerce. Cross-border e-commerce has become
increasingly important in facilitating global transactions, but it also
presents challenges related to trust, security, and efficiency. Blockchain
technology offers a decentralized and immutable ledger system that can enhance
the transparency, security, and traceability of cross-border e-commerce
transactions. By leveraging blockchain, participants in the e-commerce industry
can establish a trusted and efficient ecosystem for conducting cross-border
transactions, reducing costs, and enhancing the overall customer experience.
This seminar discusses the potential benefits and
challenges of adopting blockchain for cross-border e-commerce. It examines how
blockchain can streamline supply chain processes, facilitate secure and
transparent transactions, and enable the seamless exchange of information among
stakeholders. The seminar also addresses regulatory considerations,
interoperability issues, and the need for collaboration among different
entities to effectively implement blockchain solutions. By exploring the
adoption of blockchain technology for cross-border e-commerce, this seminar
aims to shed light on the transformative potential of blockchain in revolutionizing
cross-border trade, fostering economic growth, and promoting international
cooperation in the e-commerce industry.
