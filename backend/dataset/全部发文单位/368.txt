Abstract:
 As an emerging concept, the Metaverse has the potential to
revolutionize the social interaction in the post-pandemic era by establishing a
digital world for online education, remote healthcare, immersive business,
intelligent transportation, and advanced manufacturing. The goal is ambitious,
yet the methodologies and technologies to achieve the full vision of the
Metaverse remain unclear. In this talk, I will first introduce the three
infrastructure pillars that lay the foundation of the Metaverse, i.e.,
human-computer interfaces, sensing and communication systems, and network
architectures. By taking synchronization problem as an example, I will
illustrate how to jointly design sampling, communications, and prediction. The
goal is to minimize the required communication load to achieve a target
synchronization accuracy. A constrained deep reinforcement learning algorithm
is developed to solve this problem. We validate the effectiveness of the
algorithm with real-world data obtained from our prototype. Finally, I will
discuss how to extend the co-design method into more practical scenarios.
Brief Biography:
Dr. Changyang She received his B. Eng degree in Honors
College of Beihang University, Beijing, China in 2012 and Ph.D. degree from the
School of Electronics and Information Engineering of Beihang University in
2017. From 2017 to 2018, he was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Singapore
University of Technology and Design. From 2018 to 2021, he was a postdoctoral
research associate at the University of Sydney. He is the recipient of the
Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Early Career Research Award
(DECRA). From 2021 to 2024, he served as the ARC DECRA fellow at the University
of Sydney. Since 2024, he has joined Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen).
His research interests lie in the areas of ultra-reliable and low-latency
communications (URLLC), deep learning in wireless communications, and
interdisciplinary research in Metaverse.
