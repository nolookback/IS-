内容简介
/ Abstract:
This paper quantifies the value that households place on payment convenience embedded in
financial products. Leveraging a unique administrative dataset from Alipay that tracks individual fund holdings and consumption transactions, we estimate a structural demand model that
accounts for both product-level characteristics and investor-level heterogeneity. On average,
households are willing to pay approximately 30 basis points in equivalent annual fees to access
integrated payment services, even after controlling for reach-for-yield motives. We find substantial heterogeneity in preferences: wealthier households and males exhibit higher valuations,
although the gender difference is entirely driven by younger cohorts. Notably, the valuation
differs little between users who frequently utilize Yuebao for transactions and those who do not,
suggesting that the payment feature provides option value, likely motivated by precautionary
liquidity considerations. Finally, we show that Yuebao adoption substitutes for debit card but
has limited impact on credit usage
