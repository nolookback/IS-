Dr. Zhang’s research is highly interdisciplinary. His current research interests focus on phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) and controlled epitaxial growth of heterostructures, including the synthesis of ultrathin two-dimensional nanomaterials (e.g., metal nanosheets, graphene, metal dichalcogenides, metal-organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, etc.), novel metallic and semiconducting nanomaterials, novel amorphous nanomaterials, and their hybrid composites for various applications, such as catalysis, clean energy, (opto-)electronic devices, chemical and biosensors, and water remediation.
报告摘要：
In this talk, I will summarize the recent research on phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) in my group, particularly focusing on the rational design and synthesis of novel nanomaterials with unconventional phases for various promising applications. For example, by using wet-chemical methods, for the first time, we have successfully prepared novel Au nanostructures (e.g., the hexagonal-close packed (hcp) 2H-Au nanosheets, 4H-Au nanoribbons, and crystal-phase heterostructured 4H/fcc and fcc/2H/fcc heterophase Au nanorods), epitaxially grown metal nanostructures on the aforementioned unconventional Au nanostructures and 2H-Pd nanoparticles, and amorphous/crystalline heterophase Pd, PdCu, Rh and Rh alloy nanosheets. Currently, my group focuses on phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN), including the investigation of phase-dependent physicochemical properties of novel nanomaterials and their applications in catalysis, (opto-)electronic devices, clean energy, chemical and biosensing, surface enhanced Raman scattering, photothermal therapy, etc.
