报告摘要：
The increasing requirements of wireless communications and sensors are making research and commercialization of antenna arrays experience tremendous growth. The advancement of wide scanning antenna array become a prevailing technology to achieve wide angle coverage of communication and sensing. There have been a lot of scientists and engineers devoted their efforts in increasing the scanning angle of antenna arrays and achieved excellent results.  In this talk, an element-level beamforming solution is proposed. In this kind of design, the radiation pattern of the array element can be steered by its multiple feeding ports with different phase-combination, so as to align the pattern of each element to that of the array. With this alignment, the scanning angle of the array can be dramatically increased, while keeping the broadside gain the same as the regular ones.
报告人简历：
Professor Xue
 began his professional career in the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 1993 as a Lecturer, immediately after he obtained his Ph.D. In 1997, he became a Professor in UESTC then moved to Chinese University of Hong Kong to work as a Research Associate and then a Research Fellow. In 1999, he joined the City University of Hong Kong as Senior Scientific Officer, and then promoted as Associate Professor, Professor, and Chair Professor of Microwave Engineering. He also served the University as the Associate Vice President, the Director of Information and Communication Technology Center, and the Deputy Director of the State Key Lab of Millimeter Waves (Hong Kong). In 2017, he joined South China University of Technology. Now he is a Professor and serves as the Dean of the School of Electronics and Information Engineering, the Dean of the School of Microelectronics, and the Director of the Guangdong Key Laboratory of Terahertz and Millimeter Waves. He also served as the Chief Scientist of Antenna in the 2012 Labs of Huawei Technologies (2020-2023). His is a member of Chinese National 6G Technology General Expert Group. He has published over 600 internationally refereed journal papers and over 300 international conference papers. In addition, he has held more than 50 Chinese patents and more than 30 granted US patents. Prof. XUE’s research interests include microwave/millimeter-wave/THz passive components, active components, antenna, microwave monolithic integrated circuits, etc.
